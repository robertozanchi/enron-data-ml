#Identify Fraud from Enron Email

This is project 5 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree, connected to the course Intro to Machine Learning.

## Background
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

## Introduction
### Aim of the project
This project applies machine learning techniques and algorithms to answer the question: can the people behind the Enron fraud (aka persons of interest, or POI's) be identified on the basis of their emails and financial data?

### Approach

### Key results


## 1. Data exploration

At this stage, I explored the dataset with Enron data provided by Udacity. Key findings were:
- There are entries for 146 people in the dataset;
- For each person in the dataset, there are 21 features;
- 18 people in the dataset are a person of interest (POI);
- The dataset also provides the identies of 35 known POI's.
